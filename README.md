# Insurance Claim Prediction

Insurance companies take risks over customers. Risk management is a very important aspect of the insurance industry. Insurers consider every quantifiable factor to develop profiles of high and low insurance risks. Insurers collect vast amounts of information about policyholders and analyse the data. As a Data scientist in an insurance company,need to analyse the available data and predict whether to approve the insurance or not.

## Deep learning frameworks

**TensorFlow** is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library that is used for machine learning applications like neural networks. Tensorflow provides both low and high-level APIs.

**Keras** is an open-source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow. It is designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks. Keras provides only high-level APIs.

The Tensorflow version that we will use is 2.0. The major difference between Tensorflow 1.0 and 2.0 is that version 2.0 has adopted the Keras API as a standard method of creating neural networks.
